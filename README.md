# Simple-MLP-Network
Simple implementation of a 3 layer MLP network using numpy.

### Running the network
First extract the csv files from `data`.zip. There will be two files named  `train_data.csv` and `train_labels.csv`. Create a foler called `data` in the top of the directory. Next, add train_data.csv` and `train_labels.csv` to the `data` folder. Now you can run `__main__.py` and the network should begin training.
